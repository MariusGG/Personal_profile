# Personal_website

I will be building my own website with JavaScript, which is fulfilling and exciting.
I have used react for serval side projects so far, But now I wanted to make something use and meaningful to
demonstrate what I have learned so far.
This will a Single-page applications (SPAs). I want to show my understanding of regular applications and an SPA because they do not need to make server requests when the user navigates.
However, the application still needs a server to provide the initial files for the application to render.
